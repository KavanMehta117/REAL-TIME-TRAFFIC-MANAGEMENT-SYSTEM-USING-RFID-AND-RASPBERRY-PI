# REAL-TIME-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-RFID-AND-RASPBERRY-PI
This repository contains some python code files. The details of the project are in the Final report name RFID _Traffic_Final_Report.

In this project, we have implemented the real time traffic management system, and created various tasks such as
speed calculation, Toll amount calculation and speed Defaulterâ€™s calculation by collecting timestamp and the
unique id of the RFID tags by the RFID reader.

The most important part in the project is  that we have implemented the OS concept of scheduling the tasks, by implementing two major scheduling
policies FIFO and Round Robin. Also, we have used fork for creating process creation.
We have also used multithreading for storing the values from the readers simultaneously.

Please read the final report for getting a clear understanding
